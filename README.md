## Overview

I will have a lot of things to fix with time, but this is a initial commit. It's functional and responsive, populated with data from Faker.js generated at build time. Some of known improvements:

-   Better use of getStaticProps to make data unified.
-   Accessibility concerns.
-   Make "/recent" and "/customers" drier, as it has repeated code.
-   Create a Sidebar-Icon component.
-   Create Graphs page and Config page.

## Changelog

-   1.0 - Initial commit.
